                <p class="card-text">And I am not that special for saying that. Most of us want to leave an imprint on
                    the world that makes it better.
                    Sure, maybe our ambitions are vastly different. Some of us dream of influencing the WHOLE world
                    while some of us
                    see OUR world as the people we aim to influence. Nevertheless, all of us want to make a good
                    difference. And
                    that’s a good thing! God wants that for us too.

                    For we are God’s handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance
                    for us to
                    do. (Ephesians 2:10, NIV)

                    It is not unique to Christianity to talk about the ways in which we are wired. Whether we are
                    talking about our
                    innate personality, our cultivated talents, or our developing passions, we all are interested in
                    seeing how we
                    can make a difference in the world.

                    “God never wastes anything. He would not give you abilities, interests, talents, gifts, personality,
                    and life
                    experiences unless he intended to use them for his glory.” – Rick Warren

                    Yet there is a difference between all of those things and the ways in which we are spiritually
                    gifted.

                    You are not just talented, you are spiritually gifted. Gifted by the capital “S” Spirit.
                    Look at what Paul says.

                    Now about the gifts of the Spirit, brothers and sisters, I do not want you to be uninformed… 4 There
                    are
                    different kinds of gifts, but the same Spirit distributes them. 5 There are different kinds of
                    service, but the
                    same Lord. 6 There are different kinds of working, but in all of them and in everyone it is the same
                    God at
                    work.

                    7 Now to each one the manifestation of the Spirit is given for the common good. 8 To one there is
                    given through
                    the Spirit a message of wisdom, to another a message of knowledge by means of the same Spirit, 9 to
                    another
                    faith by the same Spirit, to another gifts of healing by that one Spirit, 10 to another miraculous
                    powers, to
                    another prophecy, to another distinguishing between spirits, to another speaking in different kinds
                    of tongues,
                    r and to still another the interpretation of tongues. 11 All these are the work of one and the same
                    Spirit, and
                    he distributes them to each one, just as he determines.</a> </p>
